## Angular

Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above") is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

### Architecture of an Angular application

![](https://angular.io/generated/images/guide/architecture/overview2.png)<br>
The main building blocks are modules, components, templates, metadata, data binding, directives, services and dependency injection.

## Requirements:

### 1\. Node.js

Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later.<br>
To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window. To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.

### 2\. npm package manager

Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages.<br>
To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager. This setup guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

### 3\. [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io)

## The Angular CLI in terminal

```
> npm install -g @angular/cli  // Install angular-cli
> ng new my-dream-app          // create a new app
> cd my-dream-app              // cd into folder
> ng serve                     // start App
```

Access your App in your browser via `localhost:4200`


# flightman

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
